Mision Statement: 

This program is meant to show the graphs of multiple different stocks at once, so that you can compare and contrast different stocks
at the same time. The goal is to display this information in an easy-to-read format and to give a bit of insight as to the minute differences
in the stocks. The program will monitor things like price action, volume, and relative progression of the stock.
