Mission Statement:

This program is meant to continuously monitor the top correlations between certain stocks and 
the S&P 500, or the market. The program will grab the data using yfinance, then it will analyze 
each ticker to find the top correlations. The user will then use this information to track 
movements between markets, cryptos, and stocks. This information will eventually be used to 
advise trades, so the easier it is to use and read, the better.
