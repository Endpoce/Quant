# Stock Info Getter

--WORK IN PROGRESS--

Mission Statement:

This program is meant to be used by a user to continually get surrounding information about a stock and its movement. The program gets the data from yahoo_finance, uses pandas and numpy to clean and read the data, matplotlib to plot the data, and spits all of that out with a summary of the company from Google. This program is a tool to practice with. This is just a playground for figuring out what works. Try new things.
