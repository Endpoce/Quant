--WORK IN PROGRESS--

Mission Statement:

The purpose of creating this program was to get better, all around, in the areas surrounding Quantitative Trading and Data Analytics. The best use for this program is to insert a stock or cryptocurrency and learn about that stock and what that company does. The user will see the latest price and volume data, as well as a price chart with the long term and short term moving average. Before the user is to input a stock, however, the user will be prompted to input yes or no for a list of the top stock correlations, then for a list of top cryptocurrency correlations. The user is to use this information to discern which stocks and cryptocurrencies are most highly related.

In conclusion; this program will give a list of top stock and cryptocurrency correlations, a price chart with a simple SMA strategy, and the latest data and description of said stock or cryptocurrency.
