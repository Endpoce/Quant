Mission Statement:

The purpose of this program is to get better, all around, in the areas surrounding Quantitative Trading and Data Analytics. The best use for this program is 
to find the correlations between stocks and the market that will highlight interesting stocks that move with or without the market. The program will then use
information to inform the main file of which stocks to trade, and when. The program will determine what stocks to trade and when based on the indicator 
described by the correllation matrix.
